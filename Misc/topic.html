<h1>Artificial Intelligence In Transportation</h1>

</ul><h5><p>Artificial Intelligence defined as "the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages."  <p></h5>

</ul><h5><p>Artificial Intelligence is a very common topic amongst our society. With consistent development over the years, many questions are still left unanswered. Our topic is specifically about the implementation of artificial intelligence within transport. Examples of this include self-driving cars or self-driving trains. Many companies are growing and developing this technology, competing with one another to become popular within this field. Some companies may include Tesla, Cadillac, Volvo and many others.  <p></h5>

<h1>Locations:</h1>

<p> Several Asian countries including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and India are making significant contributions to the field. Although these countries are in various stages of adoption with respect to connected and autonomous vehicles, more effort is needed before these technologies can be reliably deployed on a large scale. Customizing and improving the existing automated driving technologies to traffic patterns and specific scenarios relevant to Asia remains a major focus of research in this region.

In addition to major Asian cities like Singapore, Shanghai, and Tokyo building deployment sites for testing and evaluating self-driving cars, significant activity in Asia-based corporations continues to expand. For example, Samsung in South Korea recently acquired US infotainment and audio company Harman, making it a Tier 1 company (Tier 1 companies supply parts to original equipment manufacturers [OEMs] like BMW). Analysts expect Samsung will now play a role in automotive telematics, infotainment, and driver-safety technology. In addition, Hyundai Motors is working with HDmaps to field self-driving cars in time for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games. In Japan, auto-makers are working together to make self-driving cars a reality in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.<p>
