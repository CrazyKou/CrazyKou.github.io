<h1>Risks of AI in transportation</h1>


</ul><h4><p> • Lack of Expertise<p></h4>
<p>Traditional ways cannot be replaced overnight. The whole procedure of adapting to a new technology requires some time and some skills need to be acquired. In case one opts for AI, he/she needs to make sure that all the concepts related to AI from software development to data science are crystal clear to them.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Needs Consistent Human Assistance<p></h4>
<p>In spite of the fact that being able to do things, AI is not a totally independent system. To ensure efficient working, there is a need for human assistance and control.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Difficult To Detect An Error<p></h4>
<p>AI intelligence isn’t just based on handling data yet in addition it’s about learning and getting wiser after each operation. It transforms into an unpredictable checking framework after some time, yet this is actually why it’s hard to see and recognize mistakes when they happen.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Security Issues<p></h4>
<p>Many companies use artificial intelligence to manage huge data that can have sensitive information. This can be a major issue if the organizations don’t put resources into high-quality security systems. Just a single security mishap could lead to grave consequences for the organizations.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Cybercrimes<p></h4>
<p>Moreover, the advancement in technology has also led to an increased number of cybercrimes worldwide which put the companies dependent on AI at risk. So, it’s important to keep the system updated and protected against any mishap or cybercrime.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Lost Jobs<p></h4>
<p>Although massive job displacement due to AI is not necessarily likely, some industries will clearly see a very significant change. Restaurants of the future will more likely be staffed by service robots than by human waiters, and call center agents are likely to be replaced by chatbots. Similar to how domestic appliances reduced the need for household staff and mechanical looms put weavers out of a job, AI will touch some pink- and white-collar jobs in the same way as blue-collar workers were affected by automation on the shop floor decades ago. At first, governments may decide to keep people in the job by forcing companies to reduce the use for automation, train employees for new tasks, or distribute the total work hours differently, or they may restrict the use of automation altogether. In France, for example, a law already requires that electronic platforms are only usable during normal office hours under certain conditions.<p>

</ul><h4><p> • Exposure to radiation<p></h4>
<p>Alot of people will be exposed more from radion which can be lead to health risk.
