<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
<h4><em>Artificial intelligence to me is definitely an interesting topic. Many of our daily schedules tend to revolve around AI and this will furthermore continue as AI grows. As Development continues to occur I believe this will be a good thing for our future. People nowadays are already busy enough, espically students like myself or adults who are continously working to provide for themselves and possibly others. In the future AI in transportation will be apart of society, this would include personal vehicles or public transport, AI's would help solve multiple inconviences that people may have daily. Many positives come along with this development. Having the availability of an automated vehicle is a luxury itself but with further development this would gain the interest in many buyers as they would be incomparable. With every vehicle on public roads being automated this would ensure there are significantly fewer accidents as they would be programmed to be consistantly aware of the vehicles surroundings. However there are still negatives that come from automated vehicles. Many people are public transport drivers, these would include bus, train, uber and similar companies within this field. Many workers are dependent on this job and without it they'd be in difficult situations. Accidents is another negative, as the machines they're, they would malfunction every now and then. Regardless of the accident being big or small, putting a life in danger is never a good option. However, accidents happen and nothing we do can fix that.     </em></h4><br>
