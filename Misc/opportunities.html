<h1>Opportunities of AI in transportation</h1>

</ul><p>The emergence of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and their further development for road transport in years to come are considered. Artificial Intelligence techniques have potential applications for the vehicle, the infrastructure, the driver or transport user, and in particular the way in which these interact dynamically to deliver a transport service. The related concept of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) embraces greater user-friendliness, more efficient services support, user-empowerment, and support for human interactions. The overall function of ITS is to improve decision making, often in real time, by transport network controllers and other users, thereby improving the operation of the entire transport system. A future vision for ITS is described with reference to efficient road traffic management, services for “smart” travellers making inter-modal journeys, “smart” cars, co-operative systems and automated highways. The paper concludes that intelligent infrastructures are required that are dependable, manageable, adaptable and affordable. </p>
