<h1>Opportunities of AI in transportation</h1>

</ul><p>The emergence of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and their further development for road transport in years to come are considered. Artificial Intelligence techniques have potential applications for the vehicle, the infrastructure, the driver or transport user, and in particular the way in which these interact dynamically to deliver a transport service. The related concept of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) embraces greater user-friendliness, more efficient services support, user-empowerment, and support for human interactions. The overall function of ITS is to improve decision making, often in real time, by transport network controllers and other users, thereby improving the operation of the entire transport system. A future vision for ITS is described with reference to efficient road traffic management, services for “smart” travellers making inter-modal journeys, “smart” cars, co-operative systems and automated highways. The paper concludes that intelligent infrastructures are required that are dependable, manageable, adaptable and affordable. </p>

<p>also in this research Ai was used as to predict crime high risk transportation areas to prevent high jacking, car stealing etc. 

<p>Examples:<p>
<p> • Improvment of quality of transportation services<p>
<p> • Development of new and innovative ways to deal with pollution<p>
<p> • Improvment of safety on public transportation<p>

<p>Putting all of this together—the misconceptions, the rise of evil robots, the emergence of artificial superintelligence, and the cold tech war—makes one wonder how serious the risks of AI actually are. Is AI a wolf in sheep's clothing? According to the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, which specializes in identifying risks that could threaten humanity, it might well be. For many risks we commonly fear (e.g., meteor strikes, pandemics, nuclear war), the chances that they will lead to the total extinction of humanity are actually pretty slim. While these events and their direct consequences may lead to the disappearance of 90%, 95%, or even 99% of humanity, there will still be 10%, 5% or 1% who will survive them. If AI turns bad—really bad—the risk could be full extinction with 0% survival. What would happen to the proverbial cockroaches remains a matter of debate.

In response, many ask for more AI regulation even if we may still be decades away from the emergence of artificial superintelligence. Still, it never seems too early to prepare for what may come in the distant future. In 1933, physicist Ernest Rutherford said that nuclear energy was moonshine; 24 hours later, the nuclear chain reaction was invented. And it was 78 years before Japan’s Fukushima reactor exploded in 2011. Even if we try to balance the potentially serious consequences of AI going wrong with the remote chance of this actually happening, the discounted risk is enough to warrant preventive measures today. This raises a question: Should not every citizen, company, or government be advocating for research and control in this area? To find an answer, one can draw a comparison to the protection of the environment for which many say that severe actions are needed to combat climate change but only too little is actually being done. So let us now look at the main dilemmas of AI and the key domains for which good and bad often go hand in hand with each other.<p>
