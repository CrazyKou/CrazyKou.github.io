<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>For self driving car i know that it must be awesome if we own a self driving car but the risk is too high because we might sleep inside the car
and not knowing whats happening outside the car,there might be a faulty issues within the car like the lights don't work or the car might loose
control when you might be sleeping or doing something else. It's nice for having a self driving car even though its automated you must still pay
attention to the road and your surroundings just in case that something happens you can control it rather than the ai itself. For using a public
transport that is AI there might be a less socializing. Because everyday when we using a public transport almost of the people we get to socialize 
to the drivers like good morning greetings etc, and that might be made their day. But if all the public transportation turn into Ai we might not have a chance to socialize
with real people instead we can only hear the voice of the AI instead of interactions. Public transportation drivers might loose their jobs and some might change their proffesion because
Ai will take over them instead. In my own personal reflection i rather keep things the way they are now because i don't want people to loose their
jobs and it might be a dangerous thing because we might not know that if the Ai will turn their back agains us and a war might happen. Also people
gonna be exposed much radation in our everyday life which is gonna be a problem to our safe healthy risk.

And My recommendations is that we have just to be careful with the Ai around because they might be dangerious or we do not know what they thinking.
